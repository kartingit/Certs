I am currently immersing myself in the field of DevOps and Linux environments through a comprehensive learning process. So far, I have covered Linux fundamentals, version control with Git/GitHub, containerization with Docker, and the basics of Kubernetes, including working with definition files. I've also explored Jenkins for CI/CD and delved into cloud computing concepts, particularly focusing on AWS.

My next steps in this learning journey include gaining proficiency in Ansible for configuration management, Terraform for infrastructure as code, Prometheus for monitoring, and Grafana for visualization. I'm excited to expand my skill set with these powerful tools that are crucial in modern DevOps practices.

As I complete my studies of these technologies, I plan to focus on hands-on projects. My goal is to apply my knowledge in practical scenarios, make plenty of mistakes, and learn from them. This approach will help me gain real-world experience and solidify my understanding.  

Please find attached the completion certification for the courses I have undertaken.
